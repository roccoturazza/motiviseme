        <h1>Motivational Speaker</h1>
        <p>If you asked me what the most valuable lesson in life is,
            I would say, "wasting time", wasting time in doing what you love.
            The only certainty we know of, is that time passes,
            the very same way that a candles eventually burn out,
            how leaves fall in autumn and all good things come to an end.
            Enjoy it while it lasts, Efficency shouldn't be a factor 
            when doing what matters to you.</p>
        <p>My name is Rocco Turazza,
            I never had fatasys of becoming a motivational speaker as a child,
            the idea of speaking in public never particularly appealed to me,
            not to mention, confidence was never my strong suit.
            I hemorrhaged at the age of 8, Looking back on this, now,
            I can safely, without a shadow of a doubt, say, 
            that was the biggest hurdle I ever had to overcome. 
            Calling into consideration everything that I knew and all I dedicated
             my self to, until that point.</p>

        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Hi, still, Rocco Turazza. My love for art naturally unfolded into what it is now. 
            This process began when I was discharged from hospital and moved back home, I was about nine,
            Exploring this, thing, that was in the way of me, doing what I love. It's called ATAXIA, 
            a neurologic desorder, affecting cordination in all areas
